        ### Coreference Resolution
        
        For gender identification, Arthantar uses the `FCoref` module, a coreference resolution tool that identifies gendered pronouns and assigns genders to entities based on context.
        
        #### How it works:
        
        1. The module analyzes the text and identifies clusters of related pronouns
        2. It uses predefined sets of male and female pronouns to determine the likely gender of each entity
        3. The system resolves ambiguous pronouns and determines gender accurately, with a focus on proper noun gender inference
        
        #### Example:
        
        In the sentence "Kiran is a good student and she goes to school", the coreference resolution identifies that "Kiran" and "she" refer to the same entity, and therefore Kiran is female.

        ### Large Language Model Integration
        
        Arthantar incorporates an advanced large language model (LLM) using the Groq API. For gender identification when coreference resolution fails, it uses models like `llama-3.1-8b-8192` or `mixtral-8x7b-32768`.
        
        #### How it works:
        
        1. The LLM is employed as a backup to predict the likely gender of entities
        2. It analyzes contextual clues such as the name or role described
        3. If the coreference model doesn't provide a clear gender, the system sends a prompt to the LLM
        4. The LLM analyzes the entity name and its type and predicts its gender

        ### Knowledge Graph Generation
        
        For knowledge graph generation, Arthantar uses the `LLMGraphTransformer` library, which facilitates the creation of a knowledge graph that encapsulates entities and their relationships.
        
        #### How it works:
        
        1. The knowledge graph is fed into the LLM, which processes the input text and extracts relevant information
        2. The graph includes entities, gender data, and relationships between them
        3. The knowledge graph is built by first converting the input text into graph documents
        4. Nodes and relationships are created using the transformer's output
        5. These nodes are enriched with gender information identified by coreference resolution or LLM
        
        #### Fallback mechanisms:
        
        If both the coreference and LLM fail to provide sufficient data, a more sophisticated backup method is employed using spaCy's natural language processing capabilities:
        
        1. Named entity recognition (NER) extracts entities like persons, organizations, and locations
        2. Dependency parsing establishes relationships through syntactic analysis
        3. The NetworkX library creates a directed graph where entities are connected based on syntactic relationships

        The system implements multi-level fallback through exception handling:
        
        1. If the coreference model encounters errors, it defaults to the LLM
        2. If the LLM fails, it uses the spaCy-based graph generation
        3. If spaCy processing fails, it falls back to a basic entity extraction using capitalized words
        
        This ensures that, regardless of the failure point, a semantically meaningful graph is always available to provide contextual information for the translation model.

    ## Performance Considerations
    
    ### Caching
    
    The Streamlit application implements caching to improve performance:
    
    1. Previously processed examples are stored in the session state
    2. Models are loaded lazily to reduce startup time
    3. Computationally expensive operations like graph generation are only performed when necessary
    
    ### API Usage
    
    The application is designed to minimize API calls:
    
    1. Coreference resolution is performed locally when possible
    2. LLM calls are only made when necessary (e.g., when coreference resolution fails)
    3. Results are cached to avoid redundant API calls

    3. **More sophisticated knowledge graphs**: Incorporate additional relationship types and entity attributes
